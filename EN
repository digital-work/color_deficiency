<instr1>In this experiment you will be presented with images of different motives. Each target image is either in its original version or in a version simulated for color deficient people.

Following a short delay you will then be presented with the original and simulated versions of the same motive, and you will have to decide whether the target you have just seen is now located on the right or the left side.

Respond with the keys;
 - LEFT CURSOR if the target image is now on the left
 - RIGHT CURSOR if the target image is now on the right

There will be a number of practice trials, in which you will be given feedback.  Try to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible.

When you are ready to proceed press any key.</instr1>
